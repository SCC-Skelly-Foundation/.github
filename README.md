# Skelly Compiler Collection

Welcome to our page!

# Who are we?

We are the Skelly team. Providing modern tools to help developers create high end cross platform products for users.
We want to ehance your experience with developing systems while giving you all the control you need.

# How are we different?

Well, unlike most languages, you don't need to worry about memory. Even if a language provides memory control, it will still
handle it for you (Go, C#, etc). C/C++ may be too hard for others to learn or just not matching their needs. With Skelly,
we aim to provide a suitable solution to this problem while allowing you to freely control your memory. Don't worry about causing
leaks, Skelly will still help you and ensure you have optimised code.

# When are we releasing

The Skelly Compiler Collection was founded on 23/03/2023 by Mustafa Malik. It will not be few another few months before
a beta version of the Skelly Programming Language will be released, if all goes well.
